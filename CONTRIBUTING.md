# Contributing

This is something like a personal showcase, so Pull Requests will not be accepted at this time and would be closed immediately.

While this may change in the future, right now I don't think it would be correct for me to accept third-party code contributions in this repository, but I'm very open to ideas and critique for this code, so feel free to use github discussions for that and issues for bug reports!
